# NSAP Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict eligibility for schemes under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP)** using Machine Learning techniques. The NSAP is a flagship welfare initiative by the Government of India that provides financial assistance to the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities living below the poverty line (BPL).

## üß† Project Objective

The main goal is to build a model that can predict whether a person or household is eligible for various NSAP schemes based on historical data. This helps automate and optimize the targeting process for welfare schemes.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes records from multiple Indian states and union territories across various schemes such as:
- IGNOAPS (Old Age Pension)
- IGNWPS (Widow Pension)
- IGNDPS (Disability Pension)

### Sample Features:
- `finyear`: Financial Year
- `lgdstatecode`: State Code
- `statename`: State Name
- `lgddistrictcode`: District Code
- `districtname`: District Name
- `schemename`: NSAP Scheme Name
- `total_applicants`: Number of Applicants
- `eligible_count`: Eligible People
- `ineligible_count`: Not Eligible
- `aadhar_seeded`: Aadhaar Seeded Accounts
- `rejected`: Rejected Applications
- `pending`: Pending Applications
- `total_disbursed`: Total Benefits Disbursed
- `total_target`: Total Target Beneficiaries

The dataset has been cleaned, preprocessed, and augmented with additional inputs from various regions for better generalization.

## üìà Results

| Model               | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 84.3%    |
| Decision Tree      | 87.1%    |
| Random Forest      | 94.8%    |
| SVM                | 85.7%    |

The **Random Forest Classifier** outperformed others in terms of overall accuracy and generalization.

## üîÆ Future Scope

- Integrate with a web portal for real-time eligibility check.
- Include socio-economic attributes such as occupation, health status, and caste category.
- Use geospatial data to analyze regional disparities.
- Build a mobile-friendly dashboard for scheme administrators.

---

## üìå Conclusion

- NSAP data has rich potential for ML-based prediction systems.
- Automation can enhance the accuracy and speed of benefit disbursement.
- Ensures fair and transparent allocation of welfare schemes.
